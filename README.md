# 2D-TopDownShooter
This game is purely written in GameMaker Studio 2 language, and was one of my own summer projects I had in 2017. Unfortunately, all code and content is locked by GameMaker 2 Policies (.gml and .yy file format) which I did not think about at the time. However, this is a preview of the work I did.
